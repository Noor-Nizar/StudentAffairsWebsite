                All students registered in courses during the summer semester (in particular Graduation Purpose courses and Office-based courses) 
                are requested to contact the instructors of these courses to determine the requirements of the courses and set the dates for the midterms. Already some 
                instructors have scheduled the midterms for their courses. It is the responsibility 
                of the students to contact their instructors. Note that the final exams will 
                be scheduled during the period from 18 till 20 September. Good luck to all.
